      <p>
        While applying for jobs, I often struggled to{" "}
        <strong>keep track of applications, interviews, and offers</strong> all
        in one place. Between scattered spreadsheets, emails, and sticky notes,
        it was easy to lose sight of what stage I was in with each company.
        JobJot was born out of the need for a{" "}
        <strong>single, organised system</strong> to manage the entire job
        search process from start to finish.
      </p>
      <p>
        JobJot allows users to <strong>add and update applications</strong>,
        record interview details and outcomes, and <strong>track offers</strong>{" "}
        as they come in. Once an opportunity is closed, it can be{" "}
        <strong>archived</strong> with details like the closure date, reason,
        feedback, and personal reflections. This reflection feature is designed
        to help users <strong>learn from each experience</strong> and improve
        for the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built with <strong>Next.js</strong>, the app
        uses <strong>Material UI</strong> for a clean, accessible interface and{" "}
        <strong>Mongoose</strong> for managing structured data. Form validation
        is handled with <strong>Yup</strong>, ensuring accurate and reliable
        input at every stage. Together, these tools create a{" "}
        <strong>fullstack application</strong> thatâ€™s easy to use, scalable, and
        purpose-built to simplify the job hunt.
