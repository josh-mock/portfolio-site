    "fullDescription": "<p>I love language and wanted to create a version of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Wordle</strong></a> in multiple languages.</p><p>This <strong>React</strong> app uses a translation provider to update content dynamically. The current setup uses an external API and <strong>Tanstack React Query</strong> to fetch a solution, while other languages use a static word list. The app supports both left-to-right and right-to-left languages.</p><p>To help manage translations and supported languages, I used <strong>TypeScript</strong> to enforce strict typing with the SupportedLang type, ensuring only valid language codes are used throughout the application and reducing the risk of runtime errors when handling multilingual features.</p>",
